Samples of Borehole Images Datasets 

## Abstract
A U-shape as its primary structure, employs five encoding modules at different scales along the encoding path, thereby facilitating the encoding of multi-level semantic information.  2) A graph convolution network is incorporated in the decoding path to take the feature information of large-scale irregular regions, and an attention module is embedded within the convolution to supplement the capture of detailed regions.
